KojoInterpreter - need to find alternative for JLineCompletion

RMI problem on startup:
Problem starting MultiInstanceHandler: remote object implements illegal remote interface; nested exception is:
	java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: illegal remote method encountered: public static void net.kogics.kojo.lite.MultiInstanceHandler.run()

Turtletest scalacheck incompatibility

ScalariformTokenMaker - need to recompile scalariform for 2.12 (and locate custom version first!)

CompilerAndRunner - need to find alternative for setAsContext

Tracing - many more events, and repeat looks weird in the trace

Shift+Enter - extra chars in the output
